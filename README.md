Up until now, I have been using Polar's apps with their heart rate sensors to track workouts. However, I found that they lacked specific functionality that I required for treadmill exercise. This led me to having to utilise a separate app in tandem with polar to achieve what I want. Therefore, I am creating an app that will have the functionality I require and streamline the process.

What I am creating:
<ul>
    <li>Plan runs with time segments and treadmill speed</li>
    <li>View segments on timeline with live heart rate data</li>
    <li>Notifications on upcoming segments and changes</li>
</ul>
</p>
